This was my Gr.12 Computer Engineering Final project where I designed, created, and programmed Tetris from start to finish.

Software Used:
- KiCAD
- Arduino IDE

Stage 1: Design
- Using KiCad, I created a circuit diagram and PCB layout

Stage 2: Assembly
- I soldered the components onto the PCB, 

Stage 3: Programming
- I programmed Tetris and the music player
